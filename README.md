# Eyes
A pair of eyes that follow your cursor the screen, a project perfect for the Halloween season. Try not to make them too dizzy...

## To Run
Pull down the entire repository, then drag index.html into a browser tab. The expected result will be a pair of eyes following your cursor around the screen. 

## Future Enhancements
1. A user interface that will allow the user to change the color of the eyes, pupils, and background.
2. A way for the user to change the shape of the eyes from ovals to other, more elaborate shapes such as triangles, squares, etc.
3. Make code available that will make it easy to embed these eyes into another web page so others can use them in their pages.
